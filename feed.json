Not because the microbes failed, but because I didn’t yet understand the science of fermentation and commitment. You can’t rush a starter. You can’t ignore it, then hope it forgives you. I had to learn patience and the discipline to make small, incremental changes in order to test how they respond over time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">So when I finally made two starters that </span><em style=\"font-size: inherit;\" data-start=\"664\" data-end=\"672\">wanted</em><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> to survive, I named them. In </span><em style=\"font-size: inherit;\" data-start=\"702\" data-end=\"726\">The Grove of Tau Ceti,</em><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\"> V’s Druidic belief is that naming something means taking responsibility for it. Starters work the same way: the moment you name them, you’re saying, “Okay. You’re mine to feed. You’re mine to learn.” It turns a jar of flour and water into something that depends on you. They are, very literally, alive, and now that I've named them, they are officially in my charge.</span></p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"814\" height=\"814\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qRR4wGFK3pc\" title=\"Zymia and Rhyza test no. 1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-start=\"998\" data-end=\"1376\">Zymia (from “zymology,” the science of fermentation) is the bold one. Hungry, fast, high-energy, always ready to take over a dough like she’s got places to be. Rhyza (from “rhizome,” hidden growth underground) is slower, steadier, and calmer, which is <em>perfect</em> for enriched doughs that require patience and grace. They have different personalities because they are different ecosystems.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1378\" data-end=\"1620\">People often ask if their starter is “bad.” Too sour? Slow to rise? Weirdly calm? The truth is, they’re all weird in their own ways. They’re alive. They evolve. And when one fizzles, you try again, because skill learns from failure, not luck.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1622\" data-end=\"1732\">Naming Zymia and Rhyza wasn’t just sentimental. It was a promise:<br>I name you, and now I'm responsible for you to grow, survive, and live life to the fullest.</p>",

And that the most critical moments aren't actually all that important. With <em data-start=\"422\" data-end=\"446\">The Grove of Tau Ceti,</em> the hard part was the first draft: that sprint to the finish line, the calendar looming on the wall, the “don’t break the chain” word counts.</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Once I knew (<em>really</em> knew) the story, I needed others to read it and give me feedback -- beta readers to whom I cannot extend a large enough \"thank you!\" to. Because of them, I could see all the plot holes, the developmental flaws, the good parts and the really terrible ones.</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">What surprised me is that revisions became one of my favorite parts of making this book. There’s a moment, the shift from “ugh, this draft is mush” to “hol up… there’s a heartbeat under here.” It’s addictive.</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">The story starts talking back. Characters sharpen and begin to take over. A scene that used to limp suddenly stands upright and says, “You meant to write <em data-start=\"1088\" data-end=\"1095\">this.</em>” Revision is when the book proves it actually wants to live.</p>\n<h3 data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Characters misbehaving turned out to be the biggest signal that needed strengthening</h3>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">V didn't have enough agency in the beginning. I had this idea of where I wanted the story to go, but V had other ideas. Revising the story gave me the chance to actually listen to her and let her make her own decisions -- decisions that shaped the story and led to its only logical conclusion.</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Parker slipping into self-loathing (early first drafts were very \"<span data-huuid=\"10433081068981173336\">woe is me\"</span>) wasn’t a choice he would make. It was a mistake <strong data-start=\"1680\" data-end=\"1685\">I</strong> made when drafting fast. I had to restore his swagger, make sure he remembered he once called himself \"the most dangerous human in Tau Ceti,\" and then <em>act like it</em>.</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Rowan needed to shine earlier; his technical prowess and guilt over a past career-limiting incident needed to be clearer. Hawthorne was too guarded early on, and the lack of any vulnerability made her difficult to appreciate. <em>Demeter</em>'s “voice” evolved from a passive computer system to that of a true character. The captain was way too casual and commanded no actual authority. Revisions allowed me to sprinkle in notes of humanity and to fix details, revealing the soul behind every archetypal portrayal.</p>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Revision is making sure the people in a story don’t drift into two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. This is the moment to let them really come alive on the page, to let them become real.</p>\n<h3 data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">And then...</h3>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">...then it's off to the editor.

There was the loaf that spread into a lazy pancake on the counter until I scooped it into a cast-iron skillet and baked it into accidentally perfect focaccia bread. Or the underproofed dough that refused to relax, so I divided it into small rolls and let surface tension do the heavy lifting. (Flattered dough shapes rise higher.)</p>\n<p data-start=\"1755\" data-end=\"2150\">I say this at work all the time (though I originally stole it from the Internet): \"Good judgment is the result of experience; Experience is the result of bad judgment.\"</p>\n<p data-start=\"1755\" data-end=\"2150\">Here’s a baking corollary: <em>a bake isn't “bad” if it teaches you something, and especially not if it feeds people.</em></p>\n<p data-start=\"1755\" data-end=\"2150\">You adjust, you try again, and you stack tiny lessons: wetter isn’t always better, impatience tastes dense, dough likes rest, and the oven forgives a lot. Besides, bread is a living thing. Some days it’s a cooperative friend. Other days, it’s a necromancer with opinions. You learn to work with both.</p>\n<h3>Pivot Menu: Full Panic-Button Playbook</h3>\n<p><strong>If the dough is too sticky to shape:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wet hands, not dry flour; this prevents gummy layers.</li>\n<li>Do an extra coil fold for structure,</li>\n<li>Switch to focaccia or pan loaf mode.</li>\n<li>Cold rest 20–30 min to tighten gluten.</li>\n<li>Scrape, don’t wrestle.

Proofing is a sensory process: your hands receive real-time data that the schedule can’t provide.</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"558\" data-end=\"1089\">I’m making kolaches today. The dough started soft and buttery because fats coat and lubricate gluten-forming proteins, slowing their ability to link up. As I mixed and switched to coil folds (pick up gently, stretch using only gravity as tension, fold it over itself a few times, then a final gentle tuck), those long gluten molecules began aligning into a network.</p>\n<p data-start=\"558\" data-end=\"1089\">You can feel its status and progress just by handling it.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/24/IMG_5934-Medium-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Sourdough kolache dough rising in a bowl, done with folds.\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/24/responsive/IMG_5934-Medium-2-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/24/responsive/IMG_5934-Medium-2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/24/responsive/IMG_5934-Medium-2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/24/responsive/IMG_5934-Medium-2-xl.jpeg 1024w\">\n<figcaption>Sourdough kolache dough rising in a bowl, done with folds.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p data-start=\"558\" data-end=\"1089\">When it stretches before tearing, it means gluten strands are bonding and creating elasticity. When it tears or feels mushy, the protein matrix isn’t fully crosslinked yet, or it’s overwhelmed by fat and needs a bit longer to relax.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1091\" data-end=\"1499\">Warm dough, especially early in the proofing process, can be hard to judge. It's soft, and you're not sure if it's getting stronger or falling apart. A short cold proof can help with getting to know the dough better.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1091\" data-end=\"1499\">Cold proofing slows yeast activity because temperature affects metabolic rate. (Microbes are creatures of vibes.) While the yeast chills out, enzymes snip starch into sugars, giving the yeast fresh food when things warm back up. When the dough returns to room temperature and suddenly feels smoother and springier? That’s gluten continuing to strengthen even while “nothing” appeared to be happening.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1501\" data-end=\"1927\">Work it for a bit longer. See how it feels. Stop folding when the dough has enough structure to handle gas expansion. If it pushes back against your hands, that’s elasticity saying, “Yo dawg, I’m all good now.” If it slumps, extensibility is winning, and you can help gluten realign with a gentle coil fold or a cardinal stretch-and-fold. When it’s cohesive, warm, and slightly proud of itself... it has gas retention + surface tension + good fermentation... step away. It's on autopilot now.</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1501\" data-end=\"1927\">What Your Hands Are Asking (and the Dough's Answers)</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Sensation</strong></th>\n<th><strong>What’s Really Happening</strong></th>\n<th><strong>What You Do</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Glue-sticky, clings aggressively</td>\n<td>Gluten not yet aligned; starches still releasing</td>\n<td>Fold or brief rest (gluten relaxes into order)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tacky like a Post-it</td>\n<td>Gluten network forming; dough holds tension</td>\n<td>Keep going gently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smooth, stretchy, holds shape</td>\n<td>Strong gluten + balanced hydration</td>\n<td>Let it rise undisturbed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tears easily, feels rough</td>\n<td>Overworked gluten tightening or underdeveloped structure</td>\n<td>Rest longer; wet hands if needed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dent springs back slowly</td>\n<td>Balanced elasticity + gas inside</td>\n<td>On track.

It turns out jealousy and FOMO are powerful creative motivators.</p>\n<p data-start=\"666\" data-end=\"1057\">Keeping at least two things alive at once keeps me out of the existential gooey-center of “I must make progress on the 'One Big Thing™' or I am failing at life somehow.” Instead, I can rotate projects like a lazy susan of narrative chaos. If characters from my latest novel aren't cooperating, I can go talk to the goblins. If the goblins are quiet (they rarely are quiet, but they do shut me out frequently), I can work on a flash fiction piece for a contest or an open call with a specific prompt.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1059\" data-end=\"1107\">So, what’s currently breathing in the ole brainpan?</p>\n<ul data-start=\"1109\" data-end=\"1590\">\n<li data-start=\"1109\" data-end=\"1227\">\n<p data-start=\"1111\" data-end=\"1227\"><strong><em>The Grove</em> sequel</strong><br data-start=\"1131\" data-end=\"1134\">Most of the crew is back, and the stakes are galactically existential.

But Gary is an asshole and now Station has two problems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1592\" data-end=\"1850\">Keeping multiple projects alive isn’t multitasking; it’s survival. When one story is stuck in cold fermentation, another one usually starts to rise. And I don’t need everything to bake at once. I just need to make sure nothing dies in the back of the mental fridge.</p>",
