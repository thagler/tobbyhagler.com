It turns out jealousy and FOMO are powerful creative motivators.</p>\n<p data-start=\"666\" data-end=\"1057\">Keeping at least two things alive at once keeps me out of the existential gooey-center of “I must make progress on the 'One Big Thing™' or I am failing at life somehow.” Instead, I can rotate projects like a lazy susan of narrative chaos. If characters from my latest novel aren't cooperating, I can go talk to the goblins. If the goblins are quiet (they rarely are quiet, but they do shut me out frequently), I can work on a flash fiction piece for a contest or an open call with a specific prompt.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1059\" data-end=\"1107\">So, what’s currently breathing in the ole brainpan?</p>\n<ul data-start=\"1109\" data-end=\"1590\">\n<li data-start=\"1109\" data-end=\"1227\">\n<p data-start=\"1111\" data-end=\"1227\"><strong><em>The Grove</em> sequel</strong><br data-start=\"1131\" data-end=\"1134\">Most of the crew is back, and the stakes are galactically existential.

Contested even on the best of days.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1333\" data-end=\"1461\">\n<p data-start=\"1335\" data-end=\"1461\"><strong data-start=\"1335\" data-end=\"1373\">A cluster of short stories + flash</strong><br data-start=\"1373\" data-end=\"1376\">They’re out there in the world trying to get adopted by various lit mags.

But Gary is an asshole and now Station has two problems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1592\" data-end=\"1850\">Keeping multiple projects alive isn’t multitasking; it’s survival. When one story is stuck in cold fermentation, another one usually starts to rise. And I don’t need everything to bake at once. I just need to make sure nothing dies in the back of the mental fridge.</p>",

We’re geniuses today.”</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"226\" data-end=\"636\"><em>But…</em> if I waited on inspiration to actually write regularly, I’d maybe have three paragraphs a month and <em>a lot</em> of very tidy notebooks. Most of the work happens in the boring middle place, when I’m not sure what I’m doing, but I show up anyway. Because here’s the truth that took me way too long to internalize:</p>\n<h2 data-start=\"638\" data-end=\"748\">Your Muse will <em>not</em> make house calls</h2>\n<p data-start=\"638\" data-end=\"748\">If you want to find her, you have to put on real pants and go look for her. Like an adult, or something. <em>Lame</em>.</p>\n<p data-start=\"750\" data-end=\"1047\">Maintenance is the part of writing that keeps the creative engine from seizing up. It’s not glamorous, and it doesn’t feel like “Art” with a capital A, but it’s the thing that makes art possible. Think less “lightning strike” or \"glitter bomb!\" and more “oil change,” or \"tire rotation.\" The point isn’t perfection. The point is motion. Keep the lanes moving at all costs.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1049\" data-end=\"1176\">So here’s a <strong data-start=\"1061\" data-end=\"1094\">Writing Maintenance Checklist</strong> for days when your brain has the creative horsepower of wet cardboard (apologies for the automotive metaphors I'm about to butcher all to Hell):</p>\n<p data-start=\"1178\" data-end=\"1200\"><strong data-start=\"1178\" data-end=\"1200\">Mechanical Checks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1203\" data-end=\"1274\">Open the document you’ve been avoiding. (<strong>Yes</strong>, that counts as progress.)</li>\n<li data-start=\"1277\" data-end=\"1311\">Fix one ugly sentence. Just one. The others get prettier as a result, but you can still fix the next-nasty one later.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1314\" data-end=\"1389\">Read yesterday’s work out loud and circle the spots that make you cringe. There are also tools that read your work aloud; though, don't spend too much time finding the \"right\" voice (they all kinda suck).</li>\n<li data-start=\"1392\" data-end=\"1455\">Name the problem. If you can diagnose it, you can fix it later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1457\" data-end=\"1473\"><strong data-start=\"1457\" data-end=\"1473\">Fuel System</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1476\" data-end=\"1588\">Refill your idea tank.\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1476\" data-end=\"1588\">Read a page of something good. Watch a scene you admire.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1476\" data-end=\"1588\">Take <em data-start=\"1569\" data-end=\"1578\">exactly</em> one note.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1476\" data-end=\"1588\">Honestly (and <em>yes,</em> I have admitted this to Laura): Period pieces on BritBox are <strong>excellent</strong> for this (the Keira Knightley <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> or the 2008 <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em>) are the perfect way to watch three-act story structure unfold.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1591\" data-end=\"1646\">Write a question about your latest piece. Don’t answer it yet. It will answer itself when you're done and struggle with \"what's wrong with my story?!\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong data-start=\"1648\" data-end=\"1670\">Alignment &amp; Tires</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1768\">Move something from Point A to Point B.\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1768\">A character goal.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1768\">A plot beat.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1768\">A metaphor.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1768\">A comma.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1673\" data-end=\"1768\"><em>Let the em dashes live, screw the haters!</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1771\" data-end=\"1818\">Re-confirm where the scene is supposed to land. And if it doesn't deserve to live, euthanise it lovingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1820\" data-end=\"1842\"><strong data-start=\"1820\" data-end=\"1842\">Preventative Care</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1845\" data-end=\"1871\">Stop before you hate it.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1874\" data-end=\"1914\">Leave yourself a runway into tomorrow.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1917\" data-end=\"1979\">Celebrate the tune-up.\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"1917\" data-end=\"1979\">Future-you will notice the smooth ride.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1917\" data-end=\"1979\">Clean writing is something you can continue living within.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1981\" data-end=\"2256\">Maintenance writing doesn’t feel heroic. It feels like sweeping the floor. But a swept floor is a space where something can happen. Creativity likes clear paths; it can't stand obstacles, and it <em>abhors</em> debt. It loves momentum. And it desperately needs it when we show up, muttering all the while, “Fine, but I’m not happy about this.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"2258\" data-end=\"2489\">That’s the trick. Do the small things that keep the machine humming. And when inspiration <em data-start=\"2352\" data-end=\"2361\">finally</em> sticks her head in the door, she doesn’t have to shout over the sound of a stalled engine. She can just hop in and hit the gas.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"218\" data-end=\"670\">Cold fermentation is basically giving the dough a long nap in the fridge while the microbes quietly work out their chemistry assignments. It slows everything down, evens out the yeast-versus-bacteria chaos, and lets flavor develop on its own timeline. In practical terms: you mix, you fold, you tuck it in, and then (this is clutch!) you stop hovering. The dough doesn’t need your motivational speeches. It just needs time in the dark, where it can work on itself and become something richer, with more depth.</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1992\" data-end=\"2048\">Some Science From Inside the Fridge</h3>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"2051\" data-end=\"2116\">Cooler temps favor <strong data-start=\"2070\" data-end=\"2082\">bacteria </strong>-- specifically, <em>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB</em>) -- which deepen acidity and flavor.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2119\" data-end=\"2193\"><strong data-start=\"2119\" data-end=\"2130\">Enzymes</strong> break down starch into sugars, giving yeast something to eat over time.\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"2119\" data-end=\"2193\">Amylase breaks down flour starches into sugars for yeast and bacteria fuel (too much of this and you get hooch, btw).</li>\n<li data-start=\"2119\" data-end=\"2193\">Proteases snip gluten proteins into smaller pieces, making the dough relax.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2119\" data-end=\"2193\">Maltase and Invertase (yeast enzymes) break down sugars for microbial energy. Scientifically speaking: carbs go in, bubbles come out.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2119\" data-end=\"2193\">There are some others that I always forget about.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"2196\" data-end=\"2253\">Gluten continues <strong data-start=\"2213\" data-end=\"2230\">strengthening</strong> even without kneading.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2256\" data-end=\"2313\">Overproofing is <strong data-start=\"2272\" data-end=\"2287\">less likely</strong> because yeast slows down. The yeast and LAB balance is easier to maintain.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2256\" data-end=\"2313\">And <strong>the best part</strong>: the dough becomes easier to shape thanks to that chilled elasticity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"2390\" data-end=\"2495\">All that complexity is earned by basically doing nothing, which is my favorite thing to do. But it requires patience. Time bends, stretches, and ignores linear causality, especially in the presence of carbs.</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"218\" data-end=\"670\">Cold Fermentation, Patience, and Resilience</h3>\n<p data-start=\"672\" data-end=\"1112\">Writing a novel (or any piece of fiction, really) is very similar. I drafted <em data-start=\"735\" data-end=\"758\">The Grove of Tau Ceti</em> like I was on a timer, convinced speed equaled progress. In fact, I kept a calendar with word counts and deadlines, and I refused to miss those targets. That's the <em>only</em> way I got the first draft written at all.</p>\n<p data-start=\"672\" data-end=\"1112\"><em>But</em> after the first big rise came the chill phase: the months of querying, the rejections, the no-responses, the “This isn’t quite right for our list” that all feel like your starter refusing to dome. The book's publication wasn’t broken. It was fermenting. Slowly. Very slowly. Microbial geologic-time slowly.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1475\" data-end=\"1796\">Cold fermentation reminds me that waiting isn’t the absence of progress. Things develop in the quiet. The kitchen may look still, the bowl may look unchanged, but chemistry is in session. So when I put a dough to rest (or put a draft in a drawer), I try to remember: the rise doesn’t need permission, it just needs time.</p>",

That wears them down faster than writing with them.</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"159\" data-end=\"711\">There’s this myth that preparedness is a gate you pass through, like once you’ve read enough articles or watched enough bakers coil-fold dough on YouTube (watching slap folds is my favorite, but it's never as easy as they make it look), a bell dings, and you’re licensed to begin.</p>\n<p data-start=\"159\" data-end=\"711\">In real life, readiness is usually something you discover halfway through messing something up. My first loaf didn’t care that I’d spent a week “researching hydration percentages.” It just sat there like a beige swamp creature until the oven convinced it to commit to being bread. <em>Starting</em> is what creates the readiness, not the other way around.</p>\n<p data-start=\"713\" data-end=\"1180\">It's the same with writing. We can outline ourselves into a paralysis spiral, convinced one more note will finally unlock the perfect first sentence.

            "summary": "If you’ve been baking sourdough longer than approximately three minutes, you’ve probably&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"654\">If you’ve been baking sourdough longer than approximately three minutes, you’ve probably stared into a jar of flour-goop and thought: “This ecosystem of tiny, defenseless creatures has died and I am responsible.” You are not (*probably).</p>\n<p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"654\">Starters are dramatic. They sulk. They're like thirsty peace lilies, swooning over the edge of their pot.  They change their mind about what they smell like. They go through phases like middle schoolers and microbial colonies tend to do. The good news: a “weird” starter is usually just a starter <em data-start=\"631\" data-end=\"654\">doing starter things (and figuring out who they are).</em></p>\n<p data-start=\"656\" data-end=\"1044\">The biggest misconception is that starters follow rules. They don’t even follow suggestions. Same feeding schedule, same flour, same temperature… wildly different moods. So I’ve learned to treat mine less like a biological formula and more like a roommate I feed to keep the peace. The trick is noticing <em data-start=\"961\" data-end=\"967\">what</em> it’s telling you instead of assuming failure every time it sends up a flare.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1046\" data-end=\"1124\">Here are a few common panic scenarios and the appropriate non-panic responses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong data-start=\"1128\" data-end=\"1167\">It smells like nail polish remover.</strong><br data-start=\"1167\" data-end=\"1170\">Feed it. It just burned through its food supply, and that smell is the starter begging for seconds.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1253\" data-end=\"1393\"><strong data-start=\"1255\" data-end=\"1308\">A thin layer of gray-ish liquid (“hooch”) on top.</strong><br data-start=\"1308\" data-end=\"1311\">Stir it in and feed it. It's not the 9020s anymore—hooch is not a crime. Hooch is hydration with drama.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1395\" data-end=\"1518\"><strong data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"1439\">It’s not rising as much as it used to.</strong><br data-start=\"1439\" data-end=\"1442\">Warm it up (a kitchen temp of 75–80°F helps) and give a couple of 1:2:2 feeds. If your kitchen isn't warm, let it rest one or two hours in the oven with the light on after feeding.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1520\" data-end=\"1655\"><strong data-start=\"1522\" data-end=\"1560\">It smells weirdly cheesy or funky.</strong><br data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1563\">Keep feeding. Don’t over-sniff. Early fermentation can get weird before it gets tasty.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1657\" data-end=\"1775\"><strong data-start=\"1659\" data-end=\"1690\">It has bubbles but no dome.</strong><br data-start=\"1690\" data-end=\"1693\">It’s just relaxed. Gluten structure changes with flour type and temperature. I should do a post sometime about the different flours I use for different structures and nutrients.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1777\" data-end=\"1909\"><strong data-start=\"1779\" data-end=\"1825\">It looks lumpy or separates after feeding.</strong><br data-start=\"1825\" data-end=\"1828\">Mix more thoroughly next time. The gluten just hasn’t run its morning coffee.<br>Pro-tip: With a little bit of starter in the jar, add your water, swish it around, and stir until it's a white opaque liquid. Then add your flour and stir for 30+ seconds. Whip it into a cream. Even it out in the jar, and wrap a rubber band (or hair band) around that line of the jar; this marks your starting point from which you can measure its overall growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1911\" data-end=\"2113\">* And yes, if there’s <em data-start=\"1931\" data-end=\"1958\">pink, orange, bright red,</em> or fuzzy horror-film growth?<br data-start=\"1994\" data-end=\"1997\">That’s the one actual rule: <strong data-start=\"2025\" data-end=\"2059\">throw that out and start over.</strong> In this case, it really is dead.<br data-start=\"2059\" data-end=\"2062\">(If the mold is <em data-start=\"2078\" data-end=\"2095\">polka-dot cute,</em> it’s still mold.)</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Feed it, then neglect it.</h3>\n<p data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Starters thrive when we stop micromanaging them. Feed consistently. Keep it somewhere warm-ish. Switch flours occasionally if you want to feel like a scientist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Bread flour is your go-to. It's a decent mixture of nutrients and glutens.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Rye is great for food, but lousy for structure. It also soaks up water differently.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Whole wheat is good for managing gluten strength and slowing things down.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">All-purpose flour is fine if you need to add bulk, but otherwise it's empty calories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you don’t need to helicopter-parent the yeast. If it’s bubbly, rising at least a little, and smells like something between bread and beer? It’s fine. Possibly even thriving. You’re doing great, by the way. And now you have one less anxious raccoon worry to carry into your day.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"843\">Sourdough is 66% science, 33% art, and 42% intuition. Baking with sourdough is even wonkier—it's sometimes easier to bake by feel than by recipe.</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"843\">At some point in baking sourdough, you stop asking the clock what’s happening and start asking the dough. This sounds mystical until you realize it’s mostly about poking things and paying attention. Timers are useful, but dough doesn’t know what time it is. It knows temperature, hydration, gluten development, and whether you’ve been hovering over it like an anxious raccoon or a kid waiting for Santa to arrive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"843\">The phrase “the dough will tell you” isn’t advice so much as a reminder that the thing you’re working with is right there, offering live telemetry, if you’re willing to read it. Oof. </p>\n<p data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"1489\">Early on, I wanted numbers: minutes, percentages, measurements. A spreadsheet that could tell me exactly when bulk fermentation was done. But sourdough refuses to be domesticated that way. The same formula behaves differently depending on the season, the kitchen, the starter’s mood, and whatever else is happening at a microbial level that I can’t see but deeply respect.</p>\n<p data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"1489\">So instead of asking, “Has it been three hours?” I started asking questions that felt embarrassingly tactile: Does this feel lighter than it did an hour ago? Is it holding tension? Is it relaxing into the bowl like it’s had a long day? When I press it, does it push back, or does it sigh? </p>\n<p data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"1489\">Do I see bubbles?! (Oh, crap!)</p>\n<p data-start=\"1491\" data-end=\"2001\">The shift is subtle but important. You stop performing steps and start running diagnostics. Windowpane tests, poke tests, and coil folds that tell you more in ten seconds than a recipe ever will. It’s not intuition in the woo sense; it’s pattern recognition. You do the thing enough times, you mess it up enough times, and eventually your hands become a decent instrument. They're not perfect, just calibrated. The dough goes from opaque to conversational. You ask, and it answers. Sometimes rudely, but it answers.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2476\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">This turns out to be useful outside the kitchen, which is annoying but true.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2476\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Writing does the same thing. Drafts don’t care how long you’ve been working on them. Scenes don’t respect your outline. Characters respect them even worse.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2476\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">At some point, the work itself starts giving feedback, and your job is to notice it instead of forcing it to behave. The dough will tell you. The page will too. Neither is especially concerned with your schedule, but both are surprisingly generous if you’re willing to listen.</p>",
