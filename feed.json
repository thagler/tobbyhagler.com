That wears them down faster than writing with them.</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"159\" data-end=\"711\">There’s this myth that preparedness is a gate you pass through, like once you’ve read enough articles or watched enough bakers coil-fold dough on YouTube (watching slap folds is my favorite, but it's never as easy as they make it look), a bell dings, and you’re licensed to begin.</p>\n<p data-start=\"159\" data-end=\"711\">In real life, readiness is usually something you discover halfway through messing something up. My first loaf didn’t care that I’d spent a week “researching hydration percentages.” It just sat there like a beige swamp creature until the oven convinced it to commit to being bread. <em>Starting</em> is what creates the readiness, not the other way around.</p>\n<p data-start=\"713\" data-end=\"1180\">It's the same with writing. We can outline ourselves into a paralysis spiral, convinced one more note will finally unlock the perfect first sentence. Meanwhile, the draft is over there, coughing loudly, like “Hey, I exist when you actually type something.”</p>\n<p data-start=\"713\" data-end=\"1180\">You don’t learn the shape of a story by thinking about it in the abstract. You learn it by letting sentences wobble around until they find their center of gravity. Premature perfection is a hobby for machines, not humans. And machines can't write or </p>\n<h3 data-start=\"1182\" data-end=\"1468\">So: start before you think you're qualified.</h3>\n<p data-start=\"1182\" data-end=\"1468\">Bake when your starter still smells edgy. Write when the keyboard is stiff, or the pencil is still dull. Your Muse will not make house calls. You have to go find her. Begin while you're still slightly confused and underproofed. Just keep going until the words begin to rise.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"654\">If you’ve been baking sourdough longer than approximately three minutes, you’ve probably stared into a jar of flour-goop and thought: “This ecosystem of tiny, defenseless creatures has died and I am responsible.” You are not (*probably).</p>\n<p data-start=\"187\" data-end=\"654\">Starters are dramatic. They sulk. They're like thirsty peace lilies, swooning over the edge of their pot.  They change their mind about what they smell like. They go through phases like middle schoolers and microbial colonies tend to do. The good news: a “weird” starter is usually just a starter <em data-start=\"631\" data-end=\"654\">doing starter things (and figuring out who they are).</em></p>\n<p data-start=\"656\" data-end=\"1044\">The biggest misconception is that starters follow rules. They don’t even follow suggestions. Same feeding schedule, same flour, same temperature… wildly different moods. So I’ve learned to treat mine less like a biological formula and more like a roommate I feed to keep the peace. The trick is noticing <em data-start=\"961\" data-end=\"967\">what</em> it’s telling you instead of assuming failure every time it sends up a flare.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1046\" data-end=\"1124\">Here are a few common panic scenarios and the appropriate non-panic responses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong data-start=\"1128\" data-end=\"1167\">It smells like nail polish remover.</strong><br data-start=\"1167\" data-end=\"1170\">Feed it. It just burned through its food supply, and that smell is the starter begging for seconds.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1253\" data-end=\"1393\"><strong data-start=\"1255\" data-end=\"1308\">A thin layer of gray-ish liquid (“hooch”) on top.</strong><br data-start=\"1308\" data-end=\"1311\">Stir it in and feed it. It's not the 9020s anymore—hooch is not a crime. Hooch is hydration with drama.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1395\" data-end=\"1518\"><strong data-start=\"1397\" data-end=\"1439\">It’s not rising as much as it used to.</strong><br data-start=\"1439\" data-end=\"1442\">Warm it up (a kitchen temp of 75–80°F helps) and give a couple of 1:2:2 feeds. If your kitchen isn't warm, let it rest one or two hours in the oven with the light on after feeding.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1520\" data-end=\"1655\"><strong data-start=\"1522\" data-end=\"1560\">It smells weirdly cheesy or funky.</strong><br data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1563\">Keep feeding. Don’t over-sniff. Early fermentation can get weird before it gets tasty.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1657\" data-end=\"1775\"><strong data-start=\"1659\" data-end=\"1690\">It has bubbles but no dome.</strong><br data-start=\"1690\" data-end=\"1693\">It’s just relaxed. Gluten structure changes with flour type and temperature. I should do a post sometime about the different flours I use for different structures and nutrients.</li>\n<li data-start=\"1777\" data-end=\"1909\"><strong data-start=\"1779\" data-end=\"1825\">It looks lumpy or separates after feeding.</strong><br data-start=\"1825\" data-end=\"1828\">Mix more thoroughly next time. The gluten just hasn’t run its morning coffee.<br>Pro-tip: With a little bit of starter in the jar, add your water, swish it around, and stir until it's a white opaque liquid. Then add your flour and stir for 30+ seconds. Whip it into a cream. Even it out in the jar, and wrap a rubber band (or hair band) around that line of the jar; this marks your starting point from which you can measure its overall growth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"1911\" data-end=\"2113\">* And yes, if there’s <em data-start=\"1931\" data-end=\"1958\">pink, orange, bright red,</em> or fuzzy horror-film growth?<br data-start=\"1994\" data-end=\"1997\">That’s the one actual rule: <strong data-start=\"2025\" data-end=\"2059\">throw that out and start over.</strong> In this case, it really is dead.<br data-start=\"2059\" data-end=\"2062\">(If the mold is <em data-start=\"2078\" data-end=\"2095\">polka-dot cute,</em> it’s still mold.)</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Feed it, then neglect it.</h3>\n<p data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Starters thrive when we stop micromanaging them. Feed consistently. Keep it somewhere warm-ish. Switch flours occasionally if you want to feel like a scientist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Bread flour is your go-to. It's a decent mixture of nutrients and glutens.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Rye is great for food, but lousy for structure. It also soaks up water differently.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">Whole wheat is good for managing gluten strength and slowing things down.</li>\n<li data-start=\"2115\" data-end=\"2576\">All-purpose flour is fine if you need to add bulk, but otherwise it's empty calories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you don’t need to helicopter-parent the yeast. If it’s bubbly, rising at least a little, and smells like something between bread and beer? It’s fine. Possibly even thriving. You’re doing great, by the way. And now you have one less anxious raccoon worry to carry into your day.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"843\">Sourdough is 66% science, 33% art, and 42% intuition. Baking with sourdough is even wonkier—it's sometimes easier to bake by feel than by recipe.</p>\n\n<p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"843\">At some point in baking sourdough, you stop asking the clock what’s happening and start asking the dough. This sounds mystical until you realize it’s mostly about poking things and paying attention. Timers are useful, but dough doesn’t know what time it is. It knows temperature, hydration, gluten development, and whether you’ve been hovering over it like an anxious raccoon or a kid waiting for Santa to arrive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"283\" data-end=\"843\">The phrase “the dough will tell you” isn’t advice so much as a reminder that the thing you’re working with is right there, offering live telemetry, if you’re willing to read it. Oof. </p>\n<p data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"1489\">Early on, I wanted numbers: minutes, percentages, measurements. A spreadsheet that could tell me exactly when bulk fermentation was done. But sourdough refuses to be domesticated that way. The same formula behaves differently depending on the season, the kitchen, the starter’s mood, and whatever else is happening at a microbial level that I can’t see but deeply respect.</p>\n<p data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"1489\">So instead of asking, “Has it been three hours?” I started asking questions that felt embarrassingly tactile: Does this feel lighter than it did an hour ago? Is it holding tension? Is it relaxing into the bowl like it’s had a long day? When I press it, does it push back, or does it sigh? </p>\n<p data-start=\"845\" data-end=\"1489\">Do I see bubbles?! (Oh, crap!)</p>\n<p data-start=\"1491\" data-end=\"2001\">The shift is subtle but important. You stop performing steps and start running diagnostics. Windowpane tests, poke tests, and coil folds that tell you more in ten seconds than a recipe ever will. It’s not intuition in the woo sense; it’s pattern recognition. You do the thing enough times, you mess it up enough times, and eventually your hands become a decent instrument. They're not perfect, just calibrated. The dough goes from opaque to conversational. You ask, and it answers. Sometimes rudely, but it answers.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2476\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">This turns out to be useful outside the kitchen, which is annoying but true.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2476\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Writing does the same thing. Drafts don’t care how long you’ve been working on them. Scenes don’t respect your outline. Characters respect them even worse.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2476\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">At some point, the work itself starts giving feedback, and your job is to notice it instead of forcing it to behave. The dough will tell you. The page will too. Neither is especially concerned with your schedule, but both are surprisingly generous if you’re willing to listen.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I've finally found some great formulas with sourdough starters that work for me.</p>\n\n<p>I've experimented with sourdough starters before, but they ultimately fail because of neglect or impatience. One of my latest sets was no exception. I had two nearly-viable starters after several weeks of feeding (the first was over a month) with still no luck. I tried feeding variations—different ratios, hydration levels, and flour mixes—but only ever saw a slight rise from them. Eventually, I inadvertently killed them by leaving them in the oven with the light on for too long, and they spoiled.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/9/IMG_5568-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"Side-by-side comparisons of starters\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_5568-Medium-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_5568-Medium-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_5568-Medium-md.jpeg 768w ,https://tobbyhagler.com/media/posts/9/responsive/IMG_5568-Medium-xl.jpeg 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>Based on what I've learned about sourdough chemistry (the yeast, the LAB, how feeding and hydration ratios make a difference, here's what finally worked for me. I'm currently growing two amazing starters after only two days.</p>\n<h2>Tips for the noobs</h2>\n<p>Sourdough requires a kitchen scale. Ratios are based on weight, not volume, so ditch anything that uses the ambiguous \"ounce\" as a measurement. Convert to grams—this <em>is</em> science, after all, which requires the metric system.</p>\n<p>Ratios are expressed as starter-to-flour-to-water, or X:Y:Z. A good practice is to place a clean jar on your scale and tare it to zero. Pour 20 grams of your spent starter into the jar and discard the rest (pro-tip: search for \"sourdough discard pancake recipe\"). Early days of a starter call for a 1:1:1 ratio: 20 grams of spent starter, 20 grams of water, and 20 grams of flour. Stir well, cover loosely, and let it sit.</p>\n<p>Measure the weight of your empty jars beforehand. You'll thank me later.</p>\n<p>Another tip is to use an old hair band or a rubber band to mark the level. This way you can see how high it rises over time. Dry erase markers also work well.</p>\n<h2>Starter #1: Zymia</h2>\n<p>Yeast water + rye and wheat flour.</p>\n<p>A week prior, I started some yeast water (originally intended to feed one of the previous starters that was struggling). This consists of a handful of raisins in a jar of filtered water from the fridge and a tablespoon of honey. Stir, shake, and let sit for a week. When it's slightly fizzy when shaken, and before the raisin skins flake off, it's ready. It'll have a slightly sweet, hard cider-like smell to it, and a light, golden-brown color that's not cloudy.</p>\n<p>My starter consisted of 30 grams of whole wheat flour and 30 grams of yeast water; a 1:1 starter ratio.</p>\n<p>A day later, it rose a little before falling. When I fed it, I didn't discard anything. Instead, I tared the still-full jar and removed it, giving me the weight of the starter once I added the jar's empty weight. In my case, it was around 60 grams of starter. I fed it at a ratio of 1:1:1—60 grams of the spent starter, 60 grams of wheat flour, and 60 grams of yeast water.</p>\n<p>The next day, it had nearly doubled in height, with lots of hardy bubbles and a decent dome. That's impressive in only two days.</p>\n<p>And it smells so sweet. The familiar sourdough tang is there, along with a cider aroma that's so unique to the yeast water.</p>\n<h2>Starter #2: Rhyza</h2>\n<p>This one was more traditional. It was a simple 1:1 ratio of 20 grams of rye flour and 10 grams of wheat flour, and 30 grams of filtered water. The first feeding was a 1:1:1 ratio of all 60 grams of the spent starter, 40 grams of rye flour mixed with 20 grams of wheat flour, and 60 grams of filtered water.</p>\n<p>At the same time as Zymia's nearly doubled rise, Rhyza had almost tripled in height! I was almost afraid it would expand out of the jar. Thankfully, it reached its peak just before reaching the lid.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>I'll update this blog over time with the progress of these experiments. So far, they're off to great starts.</p>\n<p>I will discard and feed them again in the morning, using 1:1:1 of their respective makeup, and re-evaluate in the evening. I will discard all but 20 grams of the starter, so my flour and water will also be 20 grams each.</p>\n<p>With the discard of tomorrow evening's feeding (whichever seems the most active), I will make bread. I'll start by feeding the discard with a 1:0.5:0.5 ratio and using the resulting levain to start the bread dough. I estimate that the bread dough will take 8-10 hours, so I'll let it rise overnight. </p>\n<p>If it's successful, I'll post the recipe.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>...But that's actually a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>I've been a writer for years, and <em>The Grove of Tau Ceti</em> is my first (finished) novel. I'm really happy with it, too. It took a long time to get here, but I'm now one click away from being a published sci-fi author. I even have physical copies with fantastic cover art by <a href=\"https://nikwilets.com/\">Nik Wilets</a>.</p>\n<p>With the help of JB Kish and his <a href=\"https://www.writingmilestones.com/\">Writing Milestones</a> coaching, I could see the path from writer to author. Publication day was <em>initially</em> May 23. With a deadline set—and nothing motivates me more than beating a deadline—we crafted the complete plan I needed to write <em>and publish</em> a novel.</p>\n<p>For every milestone reached, I loved the story and its characters even more (except Hector). So when the manuscript came back from my editor, I sent query letters to a few literary agents. You know... because why not?</p>\n<p>My stack of rejection letters grew fast. And that's okay. Rejection letters mean you're putting in the work. Right?</p>\n<p>Then I got a few of the kind that say, \"I love the premise, but it's not what I'm looking for right now.\" That's still a no, but at least it's an encouraging no. So I kept at it.</p>\n<p>And then one day... \"Would you mind sending along the next NN pages/chapters?\" </p>\n<p>As May 23 approached, my manuscript was still under consideration. I pushed the self-publish date to July 25 to leave the door open for traditional publishing possibilities, while keeping a publish-by date on the counter to keep me accountable.</p>\n<p>After months of silence, I assumed it wasn't in the stars. It's cool, though. The plan was always to self-publish. Finding a few interested agents who ultimately send rejections still exceeded my expectations when I began working with JB.</p>\n<p>And that leads up to why I'm delaying it again. Agents are hellabusy, and sometimes they just can't get back to you for a long time. And I recently got a \"still currently considering the project\" update, which... [insert Carlton Dance meme]!</p>\n<p>I want the best possible publication for <em>The Grove of Tau Ceti</em>, which is why I've decided to postpone the launch again.</p>\n<p>My apologies to friends and family who frequently ask, \"Is your book out yet?\" and I've replied with dates that have come and gone. For now, that answer is simply: \"Soon!\"</p>",
