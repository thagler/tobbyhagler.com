<p>I just took this loaf out of the oven. I've almost got the timing down, but not quite there, yet. I think it needed 2-3 more minutes on the second half, after taking the lid off the Dutch oven.</p>
<p>I'm starting to get a handle on the lamé leaves; the ear is decent, but I never seem to get the angle just right. I think next time, I'll soak the lamé knife in ice water before scoring it.</p>

                <p data-start="211" data-end="493">A coil fold is a gentle way to strengthen dough during bulk fermentation without kneading the life out of it. Instead of pushing or punching, you pick the dough up and let gluten align itself. It’s especially great for high-hydration doughs that would rather pretend to be soup.</p>
<p data-start="495" data-end="508">How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li data-start="512" data-end="564">Wet your hands (dough respects hydration diplomacy).</li>
<li data-start="568" data-end="619">Slide both hands under the <strong data-start="595" data-end="605">center</strong> of the dough.</li>
<li data-start="623" data-end="675">Lift until the dough stretches under its own weight.</li>
<li data-start="679" data-end="737">Tuck the middle underneath so the dough folds over itself.</li>
<li data-start="741" data-end="799">Rotate the bowl 90° and repeat. Usually, four folds equals one set.</li>
</ol>
<p data-start="801" data-end="825">What you’re looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li data-start="828" data-end="872"><strong>First set</strong>: dough still acts like a puddle</li>
<li data-start="875" data-end="927"><strong>Second set</strong>: starting to hold shape after the fold</li>
<li data-start="930" data-end="981"><strong>Third set</strong>: smoother surface, a little resistance</li>
<li data-start="984" data-end="1027"><strong>Fourth set</strong>: it’s a <em data-start="1004" data-end="1011">dough</em> now, not a blob</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1029" data-end="1060">Why it works (the science bit):</p>
<ul>
<li data-start="1063" data-end="1121">Aligns gluten strands instead of tearing them.</li>
<li data-start="1124" data-end="1176">Traps gas in the network yeast is building.</li>
<li data-start="1179" data-end="1245">Builds surface tension that helps it rise up, not out.</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1247" data-end="1319">This whole technique is basically teaching the dough to sit up straight.</p>

                <p data-start="257" data-end="621">Zymia and Rhyza aren’t my first starters. The earlier attempts… didn’t make it. Not because the microbes failed, but because I didn’t yet understand the science of fermentation and commitment. You can’t rush a starter. You can’t ignore it, then hope it forgives you. I had to learn patience and the discipline to make small, incremental changes in order to test how they respond over time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">So when I finally made two starters that </span><em style="font-size: inherit;" data-start="664" data-end="672">wanted</em><span style="font-size: inherit;"> to survive, I named them. In </span><em style="font-size: inherit;" data-start="702" data-end="726">The Grove of Tau Ceti,</em><span style="font-size: inherit;"> V’s Druidic belief is that naming something means taking responsibility for it. Starters work the same way: the moment you name them, you’re saying, “Okay. You’re mine to feed. You’re mine to learn.” It turns a jar of flour and water into something that depends on you. They are, very literally, alive, and now that I've named them, they are officially in my charge.</span></p>
<div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="814" height="814" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qRR4wGFK3pc" title="Zymia and Rhyza test no. 1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p data-start="998" data-end="1376">Zymia (from “zymology,” the science of fermentation) is the bold one. Hungry, fast, high-energy, always ready to take over a dough like she’s got places to be. Rhyza (from “rhizome,” hidden growth underground) is slower, steadier, and calmer, which is <em>perfect</em> for enriched doughs that require patience and grace. They have different personalities because they are different ecosystems.</p>
<p data-start="1378" data-end="1620">People often ask if their starter is “bad.” Too sour? Slow to rise? Weirdly calm? The truth is, they’re all weird in their own ways. They’re alive. They evolve. And when one fizzles, you try again, because skill learns from failure, not luck.</p>
<p data-start="1622" data-end="1732">Naming Zymia and Rhyza wasn’t just sentimental. It was a promise:<br>I name you, and now I'm responsible for you to grow, survive, and live life to the fullest.</p>

                <p>Here are a few things I'm actively trying to improve with my craft.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Give better feedback</strong><br>I <em data-start="301" data-end="307">love</em> getting feedback, even when it burns a little. Giving feedback, though? Hard af. I want to get better at two things:<br>
<ol>
<li data-start="270" data-end="426">Spotting what another writer’s story truly needs (what works, what doesn't, and why), and</li>
<li data-start="270" data-end="426">Delivering that feedback in a constructive way that helps the story, not just critiques the draft.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li data-start="279" data-end="368">
<p data-start="281" data-end="368"><strong data-start="281" data-end="327">Finishing things before I start new things</strong><br data-start="327" data-end="330">New ideas are shiny. Endings take work; don't give up on them.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Stop sharpening my pencils</strong><br>I prefer outlining to pantsing. And that's perfectly fine. But it does make getting started tough; I have outlined some stories to the Nth degree and never started. It frequently leads to bad cases of Blank Page Syndrome. </li>
<li data-start="481" data-end="557">
<p data-start="483" data-end="557"><strong data-start="483" data-end="512">Trusting the slow stories</strong><br data-start="512" data-end="515">Not every draft arrives ready to sprint to the finish line. Keep revisiting them, even if I'm working on something else. If the idea won't leave my head, or the characters won't stop nagging me, trust that there's probably something worth writing.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="559" data-end="645">
<p data-start="561" data-end="645"><strong data-start="561" data-end="607">Keeping characters consistent under stress</strong><br data-start="607" data-end="610">Fear and high stakes shouldn’t erase their personality. Don't force them to act, just to move the plot forward.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="647" data-end="726">
<p data-start="649" data-end="726"><strong data-start="649" data-end="691">Telling myself, “good enough for today.”</strong><br data-start="691" data-end="694">Perfect is the enemy of good. Get the words on paper while they're still in my brain. I can fix them later.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="801" data-end="867">
<p data-start="803" data-end="867"><strong data-start="803" data-end="839">Not apologizing for writing time</strong><br data-start="839" data-end="842">It's okay to write. I don't "need" permission. I shouldn't feel guilty for writing. </p>

<p data-start="121" data-end="380">I wrote "Sin-Eater Claws" for <a href="https://www.underlandpress.com/kozy-krampus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kozy Krampus</em></a> in a single weekend. When it showed up, it was ready to go. But then one of my favorite flash pieces, "So: No Fix," has been stuck on the struggle bus for months.</p>
<p data-start="121" data-end="380">They're given the same love, the same levels of inspiration, and they share the same desire to tell the story. They just come at very different speeds.</p>
<p data-start="382" data-end="546">I'm not exactly sure why this is. It's not writer's block -- that dreadful experience of not knowing the characters or story well enough to tell it yet. Instead, it's this inexplicable feeling of "why the Hell isn't this done yet?"</p>
<p data-start="548" data-end="700">I’m learning to stop rushing the slow ones or doubting the fast ones. If a story needs more time, that doesn’t mean it’s broken. It just isn’t done yet. And just because it comes to life in a day doesn't mean it's half-cocked.</p>
<p data-start="702" data-end="743">The thing I'm constantly trying to remind myself: "Things take the time they take. Let them."</p>

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []"><span class="K6pdKd wtBS9"><span class="vqseUe">Terry Pratchett once (and often) said, "The first draft is just you telling yourself the story." And he was absolutely correct.</span></span></p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Revision is the act of opening the machine you built and discovering the screws you thought were decorative are load-bearing. And that the most critical moments aren't actually all that important. With <em data-start="422" data-end="446">The Grove of Tau Ceti,</em> the hard part was the first draft: that sprint to the finish line, the calendar looming on the wall, the “don’t break the chain” word counts.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Once I knew (<em>really</em> knew) the story, I needed others to read it and give me feedback -- beta readers to whom I cannot extend a large enough "thank you!" to. Because of them, I could see all the plot holes, the developmental flaws, the good parts and the really terrible ones.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">What surprised me is that revisions became one of my favorite parts of making this book. There’s a moment, the shift from “ugh, this draft is mush” to “hol up… there’s a heartbeat under here.” It’s addictive.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The story starts talking back. Characters sharpen and begin to take over. A scene that used to limp suddenly stands upright and says, “You meant to write <em data-start="1088" data-end="1095">this.</em>” Revision is when the book proves it actually wants to live.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Characters misbehaving turned out to be the biggest signal that needed strengthening</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">V didn't have enough agency in the beginning. I had this idea of where I wanted the story to go, but V had other ideas. Revising the story gave me the chance to actually listen to her and let her make her own decisions -- decisions that shaped the story and led to its only logical conclusion.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Parker slipping into self-loathing (early first drafts were very "<span data-huuid="10433081068981173336">woe is me"</span>) wasn’t a choice he would make. It was a mistake <strong data-start="1680" data-end="1685">I</strong> made when drafting fast. I had to restore his swagger, make sure he remembered he once called himself "the most dangerous human in Tau Ceti," and then <em>act like it</em>.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Rowan needed to shine earlier; his technical prowess and guilt over a past career-limiting incident needed to be clearer. Hawthorne was too guarded early on, and the lack of any vulnerability made her difficult to appreciate. <em>Demeter</em>'s “voice” evolved from a passive computer system to that of a true character. The captain was way too casual and commanded no actual authority. Revisions allowed me to sprinkle in notes of humanity and to fix details, revealing the soul behind every archetypal portrayal.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Revision is making sure the people in a story don’t drift into two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. This is the moment to let them really come alive on the page, to let them become real.</p>
<h3 data-pm-slice="0 0 []">And then...</h3>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">...then it's off to the editor. That's the nail-biting part: what will my editor tell me, and how bad will it be...?</p>

<p data-start="621" data-end="974">Sometimes the starter is sleepy. Sometimes the weather is being passive-aggressive. Sometimes my brain insists that 90 percent hydration is a personality trait. A “bad bake” usually starts as good intentions plus one tiny decision that seemed brilliant until it wasn’t.</p>
<p data-start="976" data-end="1355">I'm still learning a ton about baking with sourdough. An autolyse dough rise is important <em>most of the time</em>.

<li data-start="976" data-end="1355">Increase rest time and pretend that was always the plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-start="976" data-end="1355">If it has become goop that refuses to let go of your fingers?
<ul>
<li data-start="976" data-end="1355">Sorry, it wasn't meant to be, and either feed it like a starter or dump it into the trash. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most mistakes become something edible if you stop arguing with physics and let the loaf tell you what its options are.</p>
<p data-start="1357" data-end="1753">I've had some interesting bakes that were rescues. There was the loaf that spread into a lazy pancake on the counter until I scooped it into a cast-iron skillet and baked it into accidentally perfect focaccia bread. Or the underproofed dough that refused to relax, so I divided it into small rolls and let surface tension do the heavy lifting. (Flattered dough shapes rise higher.)</p>
<p data-start="1755" data-end="2150">I say this at work all the time (though I originally stole it from the Internet): "Good judgment is the result of experience; Experience is the result of bad judgment."</p>
<p data-start="1755" data-end="2150">Here’s a baking corollary: <em>a bake isn't “bad” if it teaches you something, and especially not if it feeds people.</em></p>
<p data-start="1755" data-end="2150">You adjust, you try again, and you stack tiny lessons: wetter isn’t always better, impatience tastes dense, dough likes rest, and the oven forgives a lot. Besides, bread is a living thing. Some days it’s a cooperative friend. Other days, it’s a necromancer with opinions. You learn to work with both.</p>
<h3>Pivot Menu: Full Panic-Button Playbook</h3>
<p><strong>If the dough is too sticky to shape:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wet hands, not dry flour; this prevents gummy layers.</li>
<li>Do an extra coil fold for structure,</li>
<li>Switch to focaccia or pan loaf mode.</li>
<li>Cold rest 20–30 min to tighten gluten.</li>
<li>Scrape, don’t wrestle. The scraper always wins.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the dough is tight and tears easily:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory rest. Gluten needs a moment.</li>
<li>Perform gentler, fewer folds.</li>
<li>Increase hydration a tiny bit next time.</li>
<li>Make rolls, and let surface tension do all the work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If it’s overproofed and collapsing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chill it to slow the yeast down.</li>
<li>Very gentle reshape with minimal degassing.</li>
<li>Proof shorter the second time (watch, don’t time).</li>
<li>Accept the baguette-but-wider aesthetic.</li>
<li>French toast solves morale issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If it’s underproofed and stubbornly small:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Warm spot, covered, 15-minute check-ins.</li>
<li>Coil fold to wake up the gluten.</li>
<li>Be patient, gas buildup takes time.</li>
<li>Rebrand as “rustic, dense, European artisan vibes.”</li>
<li>This is a good time to practice your lame scoring techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the dough spread like a pancake:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Skillet bread to the rescue.</li>
<li>Sheet pan focaccia as Plan C.</li>
<li>Tell people it’s flatbread “on purpose.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If shaping has gone feral:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller divisions = easier tension.</li>
<li>Bench knife practice time.</li>
<li>Pretend you invented a new shape. Make knots out of smaller pieces.</li>
<li>Everything looks artisanal if you dust it with flour.</li>
<li>Pro-tip: using stencils while dusting with flour makes it look cool when baked.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the crust looks great but the inside is gluey:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bake longer next time. It wasn’t done.</li>
<li>Low-and-slow finish, if it’s salvageable.</li>
<li>Garlic butter forgives all sins.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the dough has proofed for too long:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treat it like an early active starter. </li>
<li>Feed it some flour until it becomes handleable again.
<ul>
<li>Note: This <em>will</em> make it dry, once it autolyses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This may be the opportunity to practice bassinage hydration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you forgot salt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Garlic butter forgives this, too.</li>
<li>Serve with soup. No one ever complains about plain bread with soup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If it tastes fine but looks tragic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Close your eyes and take another bite.</li>
<li>Butter makes it prettier.</li>
<li>Bread isn’t a beauty pageant. Instagram doesn’t need to know <em>everything</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The One Real Rule</h3>
<p>Pivot early. Pivot creatively. Pivot without shame.<br>Just pivot!</p>

                <p>Dough obeys biochemistry and physics, not calendars. Yeast ferments at the speed the environment allows. Gluten organizes as you move it. Proofing is a sensory process: your hands receive real-time data that the schedule can’t provide.</p>

<p data-start="558" data-end="1089">I’m making kolaches today. The dough started soft and buttery because fats coat and lubricate gluten-forming proteins, slowing their ability to link up. As I mixed and switched to coil folds (pick up gently, stretch using only gravity as tension, fold it over itself a few times, then a final gentle tuck), those long gluten molecules began aligning into a network.</p>
<p data-start="558" data-end="1089">You can feel its status and progress just by handling it.</p>

<figcaption>Sourdough kolache dough rising in a bowl, done with folds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p data-start="558" data-end="1089">When it stretches before tearing, it means gluten strands are bonding and creating elasticity. When it tears or feels mushy, the protein matrix isn’t fully crosslinked yet, or it’s overwhelmed by fat and needs a bit longer to relax.</p>
<p data-start="1091" data-end="1499">Warm dough, especially early in the proofing process, can be hard to judge. It's soft, and you're not sure if it's getting stronger or falling apart. A short cold proof can help with getting to know the dough better.</p>
<p data-start="1091" data-end="1499">Cold proofing slows yeast activity because temperature affects metabolic rate. (Microbes are creatures of vibes.) While the yeast chills out, enzymes snip starch into sugars, giving the yeast fresh food when things warm back up. When the dough returns to room temperature and suddenly feels smoother and springier? That’s gluten continuing to strengthen even while “nothing” appeared to be happening.</p>
<p data-start="1501" data-end="1927">Work it for a bit longer. See how it feels. Stop folding when the dough has enough structure to handle gas expansion. If it pushes back against your hands, that’s elasticity saying, “Yo dawg, I’m all good now.” If it slumps, extensibility is winning, and you can help gluten realign with a gentle coil fold or a cardinal stretch-and-fold. When it’s cohesive, warm, and slightly proud of itself... it has gas retention + surface tension + good fermentation... step away. It's on autopilot now.</p>

                <p data-start="314" data-end="664">People sometimes ask how I juggle multiple writing projects, and the answer is, "badly, but with commitment." I’ve learned that when one story is being stubborn, the best thing I can do is let it sulk in a corner until it comes to its senses and decides to let me work it again. It turns out jealousy and FOMO are powerful creative motivators.</p>
<p data-start="666" data-end="1057">Keeping at least two things alive at once keeps me out of the existential gooey-center of “I must make progress on the 'One Big Thing™' or I am failing at life somehow.” Instead, I can rotate projects like a lazy susan of narrative chaos. If characters from my latest novel aren't cooperating, I can go talk to the goblins. If the goblins are quiet (they rarely are quiet, but they do shut me out frequently), I can work on a flash fiction piece for a contest or an open call with a specific prompt.</p>
<p data-start="1059" data-end="1107">So, what’s currently breathing in the ole brainpan?</p>
<ul data-start="1109" data-end="1590">
<li data-start="1109" data-end="1227">
<p data-start="1111" data-end="1227"><strong><em>The Grove</em> sequel</strong><br data-start="1131" data-end="1134">Most of the crew is back, and the stakes are galactically existential. Because of course they are.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1228" data-end="1332">
<p data-start="1230" data-end="1332"><strong><em>Frankie and the Goblin King</em></strong><br data-start="1261" data-end="1264">Frankie’s leg is fine, but his patience with the deposed goblin king who inhabits one? Contested even on the best of days.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1333" data-end="1461">
<p data-start="1335" data-end="1461"><strong data-start="1335" data-end="1373">A cluster of short stories + flash</strong><br data-start="1373" data-end="1376">They’re out there in the world trying to get adopted by various lit mags. Wish them luck.</p>
</li>
<li data-start="1462" data-end="1590">
<p data-start="1464" data-end="1590"><em><strong data-start="1464" data-end="1514">Station and Gary</strong></em><br data-start="1514" data-end="1517">Station built Gary because it was lonely. But Gary is an asshole and now Station has two problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-start="1592" data-end="1850">Keeping multiple projects alive isn’t multitasking; it’s survival. When one story is stuck in cold fermentation, another one usually starts to rise. And I don’t need everything to bake at once. I just need to make sure nothing dies in the back of the mental fridge.</p>
