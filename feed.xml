                <p>...But that's actually a good thing.</p>

<p>I've been a writer for years, and <em>The Grove of Tau Ceti</em> is my first (finished) novel. I'm really happy with it, too. It took a long time to get here, but I'm now one click away from being a published sci-fi author. I even have physical copies with fantastic cover art by <a href="https://nikwilets.com/">Nik Wilets</a>.</p>
<p>With the help of JB Kish and his <a href="https://www.writingmilestones.com/">Writing Milestones</a> project, I could see the path from writer to author. Publication day was <em>initially</em> May 23. With a deadline set—and nothing motivates me more than beating a deadline—we crafted the complete plan I needed to write <em>and publish</em> a novel.</p>
<p>For every milestone reached, I loved the story and its characters even more (except Hector). So when the manuscript came back from my editor, I sent query letters to a few literary agents. You know... because why not?</p>
<p>My stack of rejection letters grew fast. And that's okay. Rejection letters mean you're putting in the work. Right?</p>
<p>Then I got a few of the kind that say, "I love the premise, but it's not what I'm looking for right now." That's still a no, but at least it's an encouraging no. So I kept at it.</p>
<p>And then one day... "Would you mind sending along the next NN pages/chapters?" </p>
<p>As May 23 approached, my manuscript was still under consideration. I pushed the self-publish date to July 25 to leave the door open for traditional publishing possibilities, while keeping a publish-by date on the counter to keep me accountable.</p>
<p>After months of silence, I assumed it wasn't in the stars. It's cool, though. The plan was always to self-publish. Finding a few interested agents who ultimately send rejections still exceeded my expectations when I began working with JB.</p>
<p>And that leads up to why I'm delaying it again. Agents are hellabusy, and sometimes they just can't get back to you for a long time. And I recently got a "still currently considering the project" update, which... [insert Carlton Dance meme]!</p>
<p>I want the best possible publication for <em>The Grove of Tau Ceti</em>, which is why I've decided to postpone the launch again.</p>
<p>My apologies to friends and family who frequently ask, "Is your book out yet?" and I've replied with dates that have come and gone. For now, that answer is simply: "Soon!"</p>

                <p>I'm more excited than a demon with a sack full of kids!</p>

<p>My first published short story will appear in <strong><em data-start="255" data-end="269">Kozy Krampus</em></strong>, an anthology of 29 delightfully twisted tales featuring the horned holiday menace himself. The collection drops late September, just in time to curl up with a mug of something warm and a healthy fear of hooves on the rooftop.</p>
<p>So drop what you're doing and go <a href="https://firebirdcreative.myshopify.com/products/kozy-krampus" title="Pre-order Kozy Krampus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-order</a> now! Or don’t. That’s up to you. But remember: Krampus thinks disobedient children taste the best.</p>
