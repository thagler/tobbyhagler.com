One of my latest sets was no exception. I had two nearly-viable starters after several weeks of feeding (the first was over a month) with still no luck. I tried feeding variations—different ratios, hydration levels, and flour mixes—but only ever saw a slight rise from them. Eventually, I inadvertently killed them by leaving them in the oven with the light on for too long, and they spoiled.</p><p>Based on what I've learned about sourdough chemistry (the yeast, the LAB, how feeding and hydration ratios make a difference, here's what finally worked for me. I'm currently growing two amazing starters after only two days.</p><h2>Tips for the noobs</h2><p>Sourdough requires a kitchen scale. Ratios are based on weight, not volume, so ditch anything that uses the ambiguous "ounce" as a measurement. Convert to grams—this <em>is</em> science, after all, which requires the metric system.</p><p>Ratios are expressed as starter-to-flour-to-water, or X:Y:Z. A good practice is to place a clean jar on your scale and tare it to zero. Pour 20 grams of your spent starter into the jar and discard the rest (pro-tip: search for "sourdough discard pancake recipe"). Early days of a starter call for a 1:1:1 ratio: 20 grams of spent starter, 20 grams of water, and 20 grams of flour. Stir well, cover loosely, and let it sit.</p><p>Measure the weight of your empty jars beforehand. You'll thank me later.</p><p>Another tip is to use an old hair band or a rubber band to mark the level. This way you can see how high it rises over time. Dry erase markers also work well.</p><h2>Starter #1: Zymia</h2><p>Yeast water + rye and wheat flour.</p><p>A week prior, I started some yeast water (originally intended to feed one of the previous starters that was struggling). This consists of a handful of raisins in a jar of filtered water from the fridge and a tablespoon of honey. Stir, shake, and let sit for a week. When it's slightly fizzy when shaken, and before the raisin skins flake off, it's ready. It'll have a slightly sweet, hard cider-like smell to it, and a light, golden-brown color that's not cloudy.</p><p>My starter consisted of 30 grams of whole wheat flour and 30 grams of yeast water; a 1:1 starter ratio.</p><p>A day later, it rose a little before falling. When I fed it, I didn't discard anything. Instead, I tared the still-full jar and removed it, giving me the weight of the starter once I added the jar's empty weight. In my case, it was around 60 grams of starter. I fed it at a ratio of 1:1:1—60 grams of the spent starter, 60 grams of wheat flour, and 60 grams of yeast water.</p><p>The next day, it had nearly doubled in height, with lots of hardy bubbles and a decent dome. That's impressive in only two days.</p><p>And it smells so sweet. The familiar sourdough tang is there, along with a cider aroma that's so unique to the yeast water.</p><h2>Starter #2: Rhyza</h2><p>This one was more traditional. It was a simple 1:1 ratio of 20 grams of rye flour and 10 grams of wheat flour, and 30 grams of filtered water. The first feeding was a 1:1:1 ratio of all 60 grams of the spent starter, 40 grams of rye flour mixed with 20 grams of wheat flour, and 60 grams of filtered water.</p><p>At the same time as Zymia's nearly doubled rise, Rhyza had almost tripled in height! I was almost afraid it would expand out of the jar. Thankfully, it reached its peak just before reaching the lid.</p><h2>Next steps</h2><p>I'll update this blog over time with the progress of these experiments. So far, they're off to great starts.</p><p>I will discard and feed them again in the morning, using 1:1:1 of their respective makeup, and re-evaluate in the evening. I will discard all but 20 grams of the starter, so my flour and water will also be 20 grams each.</p><p>With the discard of tomorrow evening's feeding (whichever seems the most active), I will make bread. I'll start by feeding the discard with a 1:0.5:0.5 ratio and using the resulting levain to start the bread dough. I estimate that the bread dough will take 8-10 hours, so I'll let it rise overnight. </p><p>If it's successful, I'll post the recipe.</p><p>Wish me luck!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on <time datetime="2025-07-29T19:22">Jul 29, 2025</time></div><div class="content__share"></div></footer></div></article></main><div class="right-bar"><div class="right-bar__inner"><div class="sidebar"><section class="box tags"><h3 class="box__title">Recommended Topics</h3><ul class="tags__list"><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://tobbyhagler.com/tags/sourdough/" class="btn btn--gray">Sourdough</a></li><li class="tags__item"><a href="https://tobbyhagler.com/tags/writing/" class="btn btn--gray">Writing</a></li></ul></section><div class="box copyright">© Copyright 2025 Tobby Hagler.
